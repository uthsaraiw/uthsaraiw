üëã Hello! I'm Uthsara Wickramaarachchi, a passionate computer engineering undergraduate in my third year of studies. My interests span a wide range of tech domains, including full-stack development, Android app development, automation, data analysis, and machine learning.

üöÄ **Some of the notable projects I've had the privilege to work on include:**

1. [Leaf Area Detection](https://github.com/uthsaraiw/Complete-Hotel-Reservation-system)): A project focused on efficient leaf area measurement using computer vision techniques.

2. [Hotel Reservation system](https://your-portfolio-link](https://github.com/cepdnaclk/e19-co227-Mobile-app-to-measure-the-area-of-a-leaf-flower-or-fruit)): A project forcuse on building a complete a website for the control and management of a customer office environment of a hotel reservation system.

3. [Mobile App for Patient Management System](https://your-portfolio-link](https://github.com/cepdnaclk/e19-co225-Mobile-app-for-Inpatient-Management-System)): I collaborated on creating a mobile app to streamline patient management processes.
   
5. [3D HOLO CUBE a 16x16x16 LED cube for Holgraphic views]: I collaborated in creating a fully functional 16x16x16 LED cube for Holographic view that includes complete web implication, complete mobile implication, connection with raspberry PI for controlling 4096 LEDs.
   
7. [fluutter app for 3yp Project]: I contributed in creating a complete flutter app that connects to website get data from it via Wifi and send data and control signals to Raspberry Pi via bluetooth low energy.
   
9. [3D matrix maupulation]: I contributed in creating 3D matrix translation, rotation and scalling algorithms for smooth operation by using Numpy, scipy.





üõ†Ô∏è You can find more about these projects and other ongoing endeavors in my project portfolio.

üåê Fluent in both English and Sinhala, I enjoy contributing to tech communities and engaging in discussions on the latest trends in the ever-evolving world of technology.

ü§ù Excited to collaborate and learn from fellow developers. Feel free to connect and explore the possibilities together!
